This plugin will insert a Facebook Comment into your Wordpress Database when user comments on your post / page.


== Description ==


<strong>What This Plugin Does?</strong>

Auto Post FB Comment embeds a Facebook Comment Form on your blog and auto inserts user's comments to Wordpress Database.

Remember: <strong>You don't need to use any other Facebook Comment plugin</strong> with this one, Auto Post FB Comment will do all that is needed for you.

<strong> Why this is so Good </strong>

Among many advantages, you will have all your Wordpress Comments widgets and plugins still working since all the comments will also be at your database.

Also, even if Facebook goes down or slow it won't affect the loading of your site content.

<strong>And what is the benefit?</strong>

Normally the Facebook comment system is embed into your page through an iframe. Because of that Google can't read those comments or associate then with your page.

This plugin changes all that by adding and loading all the comments on your page through your Wordpress Database like the rest of your site.

<strong>It will not hurt my server performance?</strong>

Yes of course. Because this plugin used AJAX call so it does not make your site slowly. It just run in background. However, it only called when users comment in your post. The comment will appear to your post immediately after you refresh it.

<strong>Incredible Easy to Install</strong>

All you need to do is enable the plugin, set its configuration with facebook and it will already start adding all the facebook comments
to your Wordpress while the users visit your blog posts pages :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are the comments stored as regular WP comments or stored in a different way? =

Comments are stored in regular WP comments, in table wp_comments

= What if the visitor does not want to post a comment as Facebook comment? =

At current version, there's no way to let visitor posts comment in Facebook form but not posts comment to WP. But if yes, this option is global. It means that all comments are posted in Facebook are not posted to WP.
